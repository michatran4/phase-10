# Phase 10
Card game for CS4
## Notes
Phases are based off the phases found in the actual game.
Therefore, checking validity of moves is based on the following:

- there is only one number run per rule.
- a color set is alone in a rule, and there is one color set.

The program can be modified to include additional number runs.
